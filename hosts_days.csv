I prefer to travel off the ""gringo trail"" and have many more places to visit. Open to house trade.

I am a passionate student of compassionate communication (NVC). Two important things I've learned is that other people's behavior rarely has anything to do with me and that with patience and compassion, most all our needs can be met. 

For fun around here I have ridden a hot air balloon over our mountains, taken a mountain top zip line tour nearby, seen our ancient mountains during a flying lesson, rented a scooter and rode the blue ridge parkway, took a few archery lessons so I could pretend to be like Katniss from The Hunger Games, which was filmed nearby. I also enjoy sitting in the backyard watching my chickens do goofy things. What do you like to do for fun?

I moved to the Asheville area in the summer of 2013 to be near family. I love this lively mountain town full of wonderful art, music, food, beverages, and people. 

While Maryland and West Virginia are my home states, New Mexico, Maine, and Oregon are others where I've been fortunate to live. I have also lived in England and traveled through out Europe. 

I work in administration at a renewable energy company, though my background runs the gamut from social service, healing arts, grassroots fundraising, to sales/management. My degree is in cultural anthropology and sociology; I can find something in common with just about anyone.

When not at work, I enjoy exploring trails in the area, trying new restaurants, reading, running, spending time with friends and family, gardening, practicing yoga, and doing genealogy research. 

My home reflects my love of vibrant colors, affinity for the natural world, appreciation of pretty little antiques, and my peaceful, tidy aesthetic. I am kind, sincere, and playful. I love meeting and hosting new people and take pride in providing a clean, peaceful, comfortable place to relax while traveling.","within a few hours","100%","100%","t",1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'kba']","$ 55.00",2013-03-10,1447,1,1,1,1

Hosting style:  Chances are I will not be here to greet you.  I work a professional full time job, that requires my 100% attention while I am there, and I am a mom when I am not at work, so I may not be able to answer your questions as soon as you'd like.  Please try to get all your questions answered prior to your trip, so that I may take the time they deserve to answer them.

I am an early to bed early to rise person, so I won't answer texts after 9pm or before 7am.  Sorry, but I have found I need to draw the line ;)  

The neighborhood is a family neighborhood (kids next door) so please no loud interacting, no lude behavior, and no partys.  Reminder that no more than the registered guests are allowed to be on the property, unless with prior permission.  Monday-Friday its work and school week as usual, so no late nights outside that would disrupt the neighborhood.  Weekends are a bit more slack but still please no loud interacting outside that would disrupt anyone's pleasure, or sleep.

The 3 units on the property are either rented via Airbnb or to longer term tenants, so they will probably not be of assistance in answering any questions, and it would be important to not infringe on their privacy or their enjoyment of their vacations or visits.  Please keep to yourself and act with mature behavior.  

Otherwise, I am super excited to host you, and have you here at my house.  The garden I planted my self, and so I hope you have a chance to enjoy it.  I am very proud of my little shady spot.  It's a great safe place to relax and be close to town, too.

Safe travels!

"137",3403609,0,"23-06-2014","From Boston, MA  I've lived in Asheville for 10 Years. I was a Marketing Executive for Digital Equipment and, later, HP. My main interest in Asheville has been the Carolina Mountain Club - which is a rather vigorous hiking group - and one of the oldest clubs in the country. We maintain sections of the AT and the Mountains To Sea Trail, as well as lead hikes across Western North Carolina. I'm also a volunteer with Asheville Humane Society and an animal lover. Another big interest is gardening. And, to a small degree, home decor and home maintenance.

I'm friendly and cheerful and like to ""go the extra mile"".
 
In my 20-month career as an Airbnb host, I've driven people to interesting  neighborhoods to give them a morning 90- minute tour and an overview of what kinds of houses and apartments are available. Or, I've driven my guests around just to just give them ""the lay of the land"" so they can explore what they like later in the day.  I've enjoyed keeping their dogs happy here at my house and fenced-in yard, while they attended an event. I've provided guests with information on fun things to do in Asheville - like hiking information, things to do downtown and in West Asheville, including the fun La Zoom bus tour of Asheville. I've driven guests to the top of a trail head along the Mountains To Sea Trail so they could leave their car at the other end for a good one-way hike. I've also printed them maps and made a detailed printed plan for visiting the Blue Ridge Parkway and its Visitor's Center and Folk Art center and helped them select the right hike for their time constraints and ability level. 

So, whether you are job hunting, house hunting, or here for fun and adventure, I can help you make the most of your visit.  BTW, I've done a lot of international and domestic travel - sometimes staying at hotels for weeks at a time. Some were good but many were rather creepy - especially their rugs and bedspreads. Your room here has hardwood floors and every piece of bed linen, including liners and mattress pad is washed before every visit.  Do I have a life motto? Hmmm. I guess it's Never Face The Facts. It has let me do a lot of ""impossible"" things.","within a few hours","100%","92%","t",1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'google', 'reviews', 'kba']","$ 85.00",2014-06-23,977,1,1,1,1
"138",8656299,110,"29-02-2012","I relocated four years ago to Asheville from New York State, looking for a change of pace. Sure found it! I love this town and its quirky people. Bought my first house almost two years ago, and working hard in my downtime to fix it up - it's a passion-project, I love being crafty and learning how houses work! The guest rooms were first on the list, and you'll occasionally see a work-in-progress as you visit. Don't worry, I keep the dust to a minimum when guests are in the house!

From being a fast-paced-burned-out-exec I have turned into a part-time chinese health clinic manager, part-time horse drawn carriage tour guide, and student. All these activities keep me on-the-go, so we may or may not meet when I'm hosting unless the stars align! When we do, I am super-happy to chat over a cuppa, make recommendations, and learn more about the awesome guests who come through my home. Always feel welcome to text, even if we don't connect face-to-face :)

I love travel, meeting new people, and discovering new experiences!  I lived in Paris for a year in my early adulthood, have lived in many states and moved more than 30 times as an adult - as a former vagabond, I love hearing about your experiences.

When hosting, I want to be sure you're as comfortable (or even more so!) as you would have been at home. I keep the house as clean as possible for everyone's mutual comfort, and the shared bath is cleaned daily to be sure it's fresh when you're getting ready for your plans in town.

Hosting style:  Chances are I will not be here to greet you.  I work a professional full time job, that requires my 100% attention while I am there, and I am a mom when I am not at work, so I may not be able to answer your questions as soon as you'd like.

I am an early to bed early to rise person, so I won't answer texts after 9pm or before 7am.  Sorry, but I have found I need to draw the line ;)  

The neighborhood is a family neighborhood (kids next door) so please no loud interacting, no lude behavior, and no partys.  Reminder that no more than the registered guests are allowed to be on the property, unless with prior permission.  Monday-Friday its work and school week as usual, so no late nights outside that would disrupt the neighborhood.  Weekends are a bit more slack but still please no loud interacting outside that would disrupt anyone's pleasure, or sleep.

The 3 units on the property are either rented via Airbnb or to longer term tenants, so they will probably not be of assistance in answering any questions, and it would be important to not infringe on their privacy or their enjoyment of their vacations or visits.  Please keep to yourself and act with mature behavior.  

Otherwise, I am super excited to host you, and have you here at my house.  The garden I planted my self, and so I hope you have a chance to enjoy it.  I am very proud of my little shady spot.  It's a great safe place to relax and be close to town, too.

Monday-Friday its work and school week as usual, so no late nights outside that would disrupt the neighborhood.  Weekends are a bit more slack but still please no loud interacting outside that would disrupt anyone's pleasure, or sleep.

The 3 units on the property are either rented via Airbnb or to longer term tenants, so they will probably not be of assistance in answering any questions, and it would be important to not infringe on their privacy or their enjoyment of their vacations or visits.  Please keep to yourself and act with mature behavior.  

Otherwise, I am super excited to host you, and have you here at my house.  The garden I planted my self, and so I hope you have a chance to enjoy it.  I am very proud of my little shady spot.  It's a great safe place to relax and be close to town, too.

Safe travels!

The guest rooms were first on the list, and you'll occasionally see a work-in-progress as you visit. Don't worry, I keep the dust to a minimum when guests are in the house!

From being a fast-paced-burned-out-exec I have turned into a part-time chinese health clinic manager, part-time horse drawn carriage tour guide, and student. All these activities keep me on-the-go, so we may or may not meet when I'm hosting unless the stars align! When we do, I am super-happy to chat over a cuppa, make recommendations, and learn more about the awesome guests who come through my home. Always feel welcome to text, even if we don't connect face-to-face :)

I love travel, meeting new people, and discovering new experiences!  I lived in Paris for a year in my early adulthood, have lived in many states and moved more than 30 times as an adult - as a former vagabond, I love hearing about your experiences.

When hosting, I want to be sure you're as comfortable (or even more so!) as you would have been at home. I keep the house as clean as possible for everyone's mutual comfort, and the shared bath is cleaned daily to be sure it's fresh when you're getting ready for your plans in town.

  I have toured all over the country and often stayed with hosts, so I know what it's like to be a guest in someone's home.

"397",5395353,109,"27-06-2014","My husband Marshall and I are both semi-retired from medical professions, have been married 45 years and have one son and now one grandchild! We moved to Asheville 3 years ago from Clearwater, Florida, where we lived for 24 years. Prior to that we lived 5 years in the San Francisco Bay area. Both of us are originally from the metro Detroit area. We have always enjoyed traveling as well as historical books and movies. Lately back issues have curtailed our out of country travel, however we know the benefits of a comfortable mattress, back friendly chairs and sofas and good televisions and outfit our home and apartment accordingly!  My hobbies are gardening and jewelry making.  Our home and apartment sit on 2 acres of mainly hillside. When we moved here the land was in need of someone who loved to nurture the vegetation and enrich the soil so I literally ""dug in"" and began the process. If it's in spring, summer or fall you will see me outside with garden tool in hand. Marshall enjoys biking, driving his car along the Blue Ridge, and keeping up with football, baseball, hockey and auto racing. 
Our son Eric works in the film industry as a grip. He and his family recently relocated to Atlanta, Georgia as the film industry in North Carolina lost it's tax incentive and Georgia added an incentive. We miss them all but especially our beautiful grandchild Kiela, who is 3. We were able to have them close for the past 3 years and enjoyed that tremendously!
While neither of us are great cooks we do love all the simple natural foods that Asheville has so much of. We can't do without Amish butter, organic peanut butter, Ezekiel toast plus good tea and coffee in the morning! Trader Joe or Fresh Market can help us most days with semi prepared foods so we don't feel that a ""restaurant run"" is mandatory!
Our apartment is located on the lower level of our home. It has it's own entrance, plus 2 parking sites. Exterior is brick. We did a build out of this area, which is roughly 1100 square foot over the past 2 years, adding walls, electric, plumbing, new windows, and of course all the things that make a place fun to stay in, like fresh carpet and paint, new cabinets, appliances, lighting, etc. It has been decorated and furnished with various antiques as well as new pieces. We love mission style so that is seen both in our home as well as in the apartment. If I travel I always want to know about the mattress so we furnished our apartment with a Tempur-pedic  king bed and a good quality queen standard mattress. We put a Ekornes Stressless chair in the living room as well as a sofa with spring down cushions. The electric fireplace adds ambiance as well as offers additional heat if needed, although we have a heat pump. We want you to feel that everything is fresh and ""special"" for your stay, and you can expect a more than just clean apartment; one that says we feel your stay here is a special time. 
Your privacy is always maintained. When we travel it's important to us and we will do no less for you! This is a memorable, comfortable home and we trust you will feel the same and come back to see us again!","within an hour","100%","100%","t",1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba']","$ 98.00",2014-06-27,973,1,1,1,1

For fifteen years we have enjoyed hosting visitors in our Asheville, North Carolina cottage from across the country and around the world including England and Ireland, Greece, Canada, Mexico and Cuba, Argentina, Japan and The Phillipines. We welcome guests from around the corner, across the US and our international visitors as well! Our college-age daughter grew up listening to many different languages in the driveway.

We enjoy traveling including work-and-play trips to Ireland, England, Sweden and Greece. Twenty years here at our residence built in 1926 and our adjacent Terrace Cottage was built in 2000.

We love working in our perennial beds and veggie gardens.

I'm an online entrepreneur designing and marketing wooden playthings for young people. I also collect and blog about vintage wooden toys.

My wife is a clinician with UNC-Chapel Hill School of Medicine. 

We love living in Asheville and are always happy to return home when away. It is a nationally-celebrated and uniquely beautiful mountain city overflowing with eclectic opportunities for enjoying first-rate dining, entertainment, crafts and artwork. The Blue Ridge Parkway entrance is ten minutes from our home, leading to the North Carolina Arboretum, Mount Pisgah, Craggy Gardens, and Mount Mitchell- the highest elevation east of the Rocky Mountains. 

I fly fish and welcome inquiries regarding our local waters. My favorite streams are under an hour away and have been rated in Trout Unlimited's Top 100. There are excellent fly shops and outfitters nearby if you need them.

Walking, running and cycling are huge in Asheville and there are too many options to mention from neighborhood greenways and hill climbs to maniacal day-longs as well, contact us for info. Our local runner's and cyclist's shops are just blocks away.

Speaking of walkable- ditto our supermarket and specialty/whole foods markets, cafes, coffee shops, local theater, pharmacies, UNC-Asheville, botanical gardens, awesome kid's parks and more.

As a guest, I'm typically traveling for short business trips. I help clients with  technology strategy, process and organizational problems. I'm an easy guest as I'm typically at client sites during the day and happy with internet access and a quiet room for the night. Having spent much of my career traveling and staying in hotels, I much prefer meeting new people and having a more relaxed place to stay via Airbnb.

When I'm traveling for fun my wife and I enjoy experiencing different cultures, food, nature, the arts and architecture.

"475",1577750,0,"25-08-2013","Hi to all,
I am a former New Yorker and Floridian who ended up in Asheville.  We picked this place for its very close vicinity to downtown.  This place is fairly new (built in 2007) and has location, location, location.   We are a stones throw from the Biltmore Estate, Orange Peel and Catawba Brewery where most of the tours like Ghost Tour Trolley (Grey Line) depart.  We are also next to McDonald's, Wendy's, Long John Silver's, The Bohemian, T.G.I.Friday's, The shops in Biltmore Village, all within walking distance.  I went to school for cooking, so there may be a New York Cheesecake, Key Lime Pie, Hummingbird cake, Berry tart, or scones awaiting you.  I love downtown and am offering free rides into and out of the city which saves you about $9.- 12. per trip.  Most of the cool tours like La Zoom take off across from the Orange Peel which is about a mile and a quarter from my location.
I will pick up from the Asheville Airport, too, which is about 25 minutes from the house.  No transport from Greenville or Charlotte.   
Asheville is the coolest place offering HungerGames Tours, Zip lines, a new Bikebar that was seen on Las Vegas 'Trip Flip' and is nothing short of hilarious, downtown walking ghost tours, a Ghost Tour trolley, The Biltmore Estate, Grove Park, Wicked Weed, and so many places to eat, not to mention go out and explore.
I look forward to meeting you and you can consider me your 'concierge and chauffer' for your holiday to Asheville. This is one trip that will make you consider moving here.   I flew down from New York to see Rent, and moved here shortly after.  I am a true Sagittarian and enjoy meeting fellow wanderers...lol...See you soon..","within a few hours","100%","100%","t",1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews']","$ 49.00",2013-08-25,1279,1,1,1,1

I own several properties myself and respect the nuances and sensitivities of having a new person in one's dwelling. I enjoy a wide range of activities, but 'active activities' are at the top of the list.  I currently practice a self created philosophy I call 'militant voluntary simplicity' which allows me to live and travel lightly and easily. Cheers!

I love my town almost as much as I love to travel. I spent time backpacking SE Asia in the spring of 2013 and realized the contribution that fellow travelers and those you meet along the way really make to your journey.  I'm in nursing school through Western Carolina University and hope to move West upon graduation. Sometimes my mutt, Lotus, travels with me but sometimes he stays with my friends. Following nursing, my dog, my people, and traveling... is music. Of course it's music. It may not be in that order either but I live for music as long as there isn't too much of a twang involved. And food. Wonderful, weird food. 

I always leave a room cleaner than when I arrived. I even make my bed every morning. My remotes even have a certain arrangement that they must sit in.

"699",6674139,110,"14-01-2014","Hi, I'm Julie

I was born in N.J, although you would never guess (No Jersey accent here!).   I moved with my family to Clearwater, Florida when I was in high school and graduated from the University of South Florida in Tampa with a degree in Psychology. I eventually heard about Asheville, NC, visited, moved there and lived there full time for 15 years. For the last 6 years I have been splitting my time between Dunedin,(just north of Clearwater) Florida and Asheville, NC, two delightfully beautiful, creative and diverse cities, I absolutely adore. 

 I love the beaches of Florida, but my heart is always drawn back to the mountains.

 When I first moved to North Carolina, I was a social worker. Through some friends, I was drawn into a seasonal inn- keeping position at a ski lodge in Beech Mtn, North Carolina. That lead me to work for a couple of years at the Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville as a concierge.

Ultimately, I decided I wanted to have my own vacation rentals.

That dream has finally materialized and I have furnished vacation rentals in Asheville and Dunedin, where I divide my time. I enjoy traveling, meeting people and providing the most comfortable and  friendly lodging that I can.

My attraction to Asheville & Dunedin besides the natural surroundings are the great outdoor recreation opportunities- biking, hiking, whitewater rafting, motorcycle rides on the Blue Ridge Parkway, kayaking, tennis and lounging at the beach.  I also love the warm, intelligent, creative people of both Asheville & Dunedin, the abundant live music, the vibrant arts scene, many incredible restaurants, and its celebration of diversity.

SO WELCOME TO ASHEVILLE & DUNEDIN!

When I travel, I prefer to stay in individually owned places like cottages, B&B's, hostels, condos and apartments instead of generic hotels. And I want my guests to experience the incredible vibes of Asheville & Dunedin, to enjoy a quiet, comforting, unique get a way, and then come back often to visit.

 The welcome mat is always out ! Either myself or a friend is always available, should the need arise during your stay.

 There is a lock box  for your convenience, so no worries about conflicting schedules, late arrivals, etc. 

 I can be contacted via phone, text or email, before, during and after your stay.

My life motto;

âSecurity is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of humans as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."" Helen Keller

Best places to sit, sip, nibble and dream: The Battery Park Book Exchange, High Five Coffee, Dobra Tea House, The Coffee Bus, Vortex Donuts, Malaprops bookstore.

I'll see anything that's playing at: the Fine Arts Movie Theater, the Mothlight music venue.

"733",2214960,111,"14-01-2014","Hi, I'm Julie

I was born in N.J, although you would never guess (No Jersey accent here!).   I moved with my family to Clearwater, Florida when I was in high school and graduated from the University of South Florida in Tampa with a degree in Psychology. I eventually heard about Asheville, NC, visited, moved there and lived there full time for 15 years. For the last 6 years I have been splitting my time between Dunedin,(just north of Clearwater) Florida and Asheville, NC, two delightfully beautiful, creative and diverse cities, I absolutely adore. 

 I love the beaches of Florida, but my heart is always drawn back to the mountains.

 When I first moved to North Carolina, I was a social worker. Through some friends, I was drawn into a seasonal inn- keeping position at a ski lodge in Beech Mtn, North Carolina. That lead me to work for a couple of years at the Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville as a concierge.

Ultimately, I decided I wanted to have my own vacation rentals.

That dream has finally materialized and I have furnished vacation rentals in Asheville and Dunedin, where I divide my time. I enjoy traveling, meeting people and providing the most comfortable and  friendly lodging that I can.

My attraction to Asheville & Dunedin besides the natural surroundings are the great outdoor recreation opportunities- biking, hiking, whitewater rafting, motorcycle rides on the Blue Ridge Parkway, kayaking, tennis and lounging at the beach.  I also love the warm, intelligent, creative people of both Asheville & Dunedin, the abundant live music, the vibrant arts scene, many incredible restaurants, and its celebration of diversity.

SO WELCOME TO ASHEVILLE & DUNEDIN!

When I travel, I prefer to stay in individually owned places like cottages, B&B's, hostels, condos and apartments instead of generic hotels. And I want my guests to experience the incredible vibes of Asheville & Dunedin, to enjoy a quiet, comforting, unique get a way, and then come back often to visit.

 The welcome mat is always out ! Either myself or a friend is always available, should the need arise during your stay.

 There is a lock box  for your convenience, so no worries about conflicting schedules, late arrivals, etc. 

 I can be contacted via phone, text or email, before, during and after your stay.

My life motto;

âSecurity is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of humans as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."" Helen Keller

Here's to your life adventures!

Cheers,
Julie","within an hour","94%","96%","t",5,5,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba']","$ 130.00",2014-01-14,1137,1,1,1,1

"807",1480224,0,"02-07-2013","Hi, I'm Karen, (the gal on the left) an on-the-go Asheville native with a high energy level, love for decorating, quest for innovation and inherent need for thinking outside of the box. For the past 7 years, I have owned and managed two very successful short term vacation rentals where guests occupied the entire space, yet the home remained void of me as a host. Most recently, I have changed directions, opening rooms in my home to travelers like yourself to offer comfortable, well-thought out spaces with a fun, eclectic vibe and all the comforts of home.

I am a high ""D"" personality type, a doer, a get-it-done type of girl. My ""I"" falls close second, and in good company, I have a lot to say and will use large gestures to make my point. I can't live without change, chocolate, earl grey tea, music and inspiring words. I prefer to surround myself with positive, driven people or those constantly moving forward to create their best life possible! 

I am a low-key host with a limited presence and one that allows you the freedom of use for the common areas and of course, your own personal space. It is my goal to ensure that you are comfortable, making my home your own. I am confident that you will find Out on a Limb to exceed your expectations, where unlike most rentals, my experience in the business translates for you as an above average accommodation. 

Thank you for taking the time to read on and learn more about Out on a Limb. I appreciate the opportunity to be your host during your time in Asheville and look forward to our connection!","within an hour","100%","83%","f",1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'kba']","$ 89.00",2013-07-02,1333,1,1,1,1

"848",11824960,0,"30-03-2014","Hi!  

My name is Austin!  I'm an RN in Asheville, North Carolina.  Total work-a-holic, but I'm trying to start traveling more.  In my free time, I'm all about anything outside, always followed up with a few margaritas.  I love to read, Garth Stein being my favorite author, and I'm shamelessly obsessed with self help novels.  Music is pretty nonstop in my house, I listen to mostly indie/alternative stuff, but I also love reggae and jazz.  I'm all about making the most out of my life and having a great time with everything I do.  

I won't lie, I'm kind of a neat-freak, but aside from that I'm super easygoing and laid-back.  I can't wait to meet you! 

At home, I'm pretty big on recycling and repurposing, and I'm currently beginning to compost as well.  My home (me) is about 90% vegan and I have a gluten allergy.  I keep a pretty put-together, neat house with great energy.","within an hour","100%","100%","f",1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews']","$ 95.00",2014-03-30,1062,1,1,1,1

I have done a fair amount of traveling including Peru (Machu Pichu), Tibet, Nepal, Thailand, Costa Rica and Europe. I consider myself very down to earth, fun, considerate and I love meeting new people. My cottage is very attractive and cozy.   I like to cook healthy food often with an ethnic flair.

David does a lot of trail building/repair as a trail crew leader for our local mt. bike club.  We are pretty boring otherwise.  We will most likely go to bed early, etc.  Lately, our travel destinations usually involve rock climbing.  We have been lots of places here in the SE and City of Rocks, Smith Rock, Yosemite, and Joshua Tree out west.  We are pretty quiet.  You could describe us as conservative liberals.  We are not up on the local beer/restaurant scene but can make some suggestions.  We are close to Buncombe/Henderson bus lines, but public transportation is not great here.  A car would be best.  We could probably pick you up/drop you at the airport, which is 1 mile away.  You can hear the planes take off, but it is not that loud.

I am a pescatarian and eat as local and organic as I can. I am happy to advise you on any of the great activities in town.  I'm located near the North Carolina Arboretum, Pisgah National Forest, DuPont State Park, Hendersonville and both The French Broad and Green Rivers.

We both work from home and travel for work, so most of our free time is spent enjoying our home. When we get the chance to take a trip we like to see and do all that we can in a short amount of time. We are hoping Airbnb allows us to travel more and slow down a bit.

We love kayaking, walking, getting the behind the scene's look on a new place, food, food, food... window shopping, exploring, nature and a good craft beer or a big glass of red at the end of the day. We love Italy and being out West the most but the last few years we have really enjoyed hiking and exploring the mountains, lakes and rivers of WNC.

We aren't much in to hanging around, we really like to be out an about. We like learning and sharing stories but won't be looking for you to plan our trip. We are also looking to become hosts as we have a great space in our home, an incredible destination in Asheville and enjoy meeting people and learning of their experiences.
